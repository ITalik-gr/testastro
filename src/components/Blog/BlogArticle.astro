    You might have made a Google search for a product that you want, but you hesitated on clicking that purchase button. After a few hours or days, upon checking your Facebook feed, you will notice that a related ad shows up.
  </p>

  <p>
    After viewing the ad, it convinced you to continue that purchase. What makes this phenomenon possible? The answer is Facebook retargeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Facebook retargeting is a marketing strategy that follows up leads. It works by loading a Facebook pixel on websites that follows customers and tracks their actions. <br>
    Businesses use a Facebook retargeting strategy to show ads on the news feed of their potential customers. We can say that it is sneaky, but several digital marketers proved it to be effective.

  <p>
    The second consideration for Facebook retargeting is doing it at the right time. You can show your ad immediately or sporadically. You can also run ad campaigns before items expire or during special occasions such as the days before Black Friday.
